# ESLint, Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code

Two files called `.eslintrc.json` and
`.eslintignore` are added to the root of the repository which contains the
coding standards and files excluded from analysis.

A third file called `package.json` is added which contains the needed npm
modules. Run `npm install` after the installation in order to enable ESLint:

```shell
npm install
```
