# Coding Standard validation (PHPCS / PHP_CodeSniffer) 

The coding style is validated using PHPCS and uses the
[Youwe Coding Standard](https://github.com/YouweGit/coding-standard).

During the installation of the testing suite a file called `phpcs.xml` is added to
the root of the repository which refers to the coding standard. To make
adjustments to the coding standard this file can be edited and committed.
